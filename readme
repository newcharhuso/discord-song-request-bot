In this bot my aim was givinng users ability to create a common song culture specific to discord channel bot used in.

Bot's invite link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=837650252861014076&permissions=2048&scope=bot 

Commands(use them with prefix ","): 

-add <song name that user wants to add>: Searchs for the song in Spotfiy then adds the most popular result to the playlist with the same name of the discord server. 
First command you write in a server doesn't work. After the 2nd add command bot sends the link to the playlist. 

-link: Sends the link for the playlist. 

I am currently running this program on a DigitalOcean server which is free for 2 months. I will keep running the server if the bot is used. If you want to support me 
you can use it or contact me from Discord: Omo-san#4359 

Any support would be appriciated! 

Update 1: This bot now also creates YoutubePlaylists
